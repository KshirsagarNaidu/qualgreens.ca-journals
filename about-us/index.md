    <h3 class="display-6">About Us</h3>
    <p>We at QualGreens Publishing strives to facilitate a sustainable open-access publishing platform for all wakes of research societies.</p>
    <p>QualGreens Publishing strongly advocates open-access publishing and thus provides the resources and support for the authors and peer-reviewers whom submit or review the manuscripts thorughout the process.<br>We take authorship copyright and licenses seriously and hope to see the authors works freely distributed under the open-access initiative.</p>
    <p>We recognize the difficulties that many developing countries would have in regards to fees and pricing, and thus we have discounts or fee waivers for manuscripts written by authors from select countries. Please contact our support for further information.</p>
