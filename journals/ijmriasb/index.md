        <h3 class="display-6">Scope</h3>
        <hr class="my-3">
        <p>The scope of the journal is diverse, and trans-disciplinary intended to touch across a broad spectrum of beneficiaries
          internationally. Within science and technology, we know that most products and services are outcomes of teams comprising
          of different disciplines and subdisciplines. Moreover, a successful product or service cannot reach an end-user without
          application of appropriate management acumen and consideration of legal and regulatory frameworks nationally or even
          globally. The products and services may also have social impact such as emotional, cultural, financial, environmental,
          sustainability and other repercussions, creating the framework for interesting multi-disciplinary avenues of research.</p>
        <p>Several aspects of humanities and social sciences are deeply entrenched in the technological framework in which the society
          lives. Explosion of the mobile and internet technologies and their affordable penetration in the society is just one
          such example.</p>
        <p>A niche area that the journal wishes to cover is to provide a platform for publication of potentially patentable utility
          or design embodiments or processes where the innovators are not interested to exploit commercially securing monopolistic
          intellectual property rights for whatever reasons. Such disclosures through publications would serve an important cause
          for the benefit of the society by making the potential innovation open for public use freely and perpetually for non-commercial
          as well as commercial purposes by individuals, small firms and start-up entrepreneurs without any barriers for entry,
          thus providing valuable freedom of operation. Fuzzy areas such as business methods that are often at the cross roads
          of technology, management and law with patentability under a question mark in most countries, yet examples of corporate
          success to secure monopoly further manifests a need for such publications to preempt unfair exploitations.</p>

          <h5 class="display-6 my-3">Aims</h5>
          <p>The primary aim of this journal is to bridge the gap between scholarly research and societal benefit by presentation of applications of research and innovation for the community; preferably in active collaboration with the beneficiaries wherever feasible. This may be demonstrated, for example, by a group of co-authors from the academia having joint coauthorship with members of the user community, or other innovative models that may evolve.</p>
          <p>To further illustrate, co-authors may constitute technology: academic-industry; management: academic-corporate; social science: academic-NGO or a community stake holder, corporate-NGO; educationist: academician-learner; health care: professional-patient or patient groups; agricultural: academic- farmer or farming community; geo-scientific: academic-exploration and mining stake holders including industry as well as concerned communities, and numerous other combinations of diverse fields, actors and entities whose interests overlap or intersect.</p>
          <p>We understand that this task is easier said than done and is immensely challenging as it is a paradigm shift from what has substantially been the aim of traditional scholarly academic publishing. However, societal benefit is an important criteria still at early stages (Bornmann, L. “Measuring the social impact of research”, EMBO reports, vol. 3, no. 8, pp 673-676, 2012) and the aim of this journal is to advance towards steps to be able to measure and recognise such impacts. Further, we fully understand the importance of traditional scholarly publication and thus intend to complement the same avoiding competition or duplication as the aims are different.</p>

          <h5 class="display-6">Author Guidelines</h5>
          <p>This journal follows the author guidelines provided by The Royal Society for majority of the journals published by them, Interface in particular. These guidelines are available at: <a href="https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/">https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/</a></p>
          <p>However, authors may note that this journal extends the trans-disciplinary nature beyond physical and life sciences (considering Interface as the format to follow) with possibilities to discuss social sciences, management, humanities, and law if and wherever relevant. To accommodate this expected nature of articles, Harvard style of referencing and citation is adopted.</p>

        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="submission-process">
          <h5 class="display-6 my-3">Submission Process</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>All editorial correspondence and manuscript submissions should be addressed to: The Editor-in-Chief, International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Innovation Applications for Societal Benefit, by E-mail to <a href="mailto:editor@qualgreens.ca">editor</a>.</li>
            <li>Author(s) are requested to specify the type of article under which it needs to be considered: research article (2,500-8,000 words), reviews (5,000-10,000 words), letters style reports (1,000-2,500 words), and patent applications style innovation disclosures (1,000-10,000 words). The manuscripts should be double spaced, 1 inch margin all round, preferably A4 size (Letter size acceptable but will be converted to A4 size during publication process), Arial 11 font size. An abstract of around 200 words and 3-6 keywords need to be provided.</li>
            <li>The publisher of this journal believes that the author(s) should hold the copyright of their work, not the publisher. As such, all authors are required to grant a licence to publish, the format for which will be sent to the author(s) once the manuscript is accepted for publication.</li>
            <li>The publisher of this journal strongly supports open access by any and all the stakeholders, interested parties or potential beneficiaries including researchers, end users, industry, policy makers, governments, and the communities at large. Once an article is published online, it is available for all globally and perpetually under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY) licence. To support the open access, author(s) or preferably their organisations are requested to contribute a nominal article maintenance charge which depends on the location of the author(s) as per the United Nations classification of High-income, Upper-middle-income, Lower-middle-income, and Low-income. To know the classification of the country at the time of publication, and the applicable charges, please contact <a href="mailto:support@qualgreens.ca">support</a>. The article maintenance charges may be offset or waived either partially or fully through a variety of support mechanisms not limited to philanthropy (for example, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Grand Challenges Canada), Governmental and private grants, and host institutional sponsorships. To avoid any biases, conflict of interest statements will be requested where applicable, e.g. where funding agency or host institutional sponsor has a relationship with one or more authors.</li>

        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="publication-ethics">
          <h5 class="display-6 my-3">Publication Ethics</h5>
          <p>The endeavour of this journal is to follow the guidelines and provisions as suggested by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). Please go through the universally accepted principles, case studies, evolving norms and discussions at the COPE website (https://publicationethics.org/) before submission of manuscript to avoid deliberate or inadvertent violations. For example, authors may note that this journal has adopted a version of the standard, blinded, peer review process for a journal as per the chart suggested by COPE at page 2 of the guidelines <a href="//publicationethics.org/files/Ethical_Guidelines_For_Peer_Reviewers_2.pdf">https://publicationethics.org/files/Ethical_Guidelines_For_Peer_Reviewers_2.pdf</a></p>
          <p>Timing: Pre-publication; Identification: Single blind; Mediation: Editor-in-chief or other authorised editors mediate all interactions between reviewers and authors; Publication: Peer reviews are not published; Facilitation: Review is facilitated by the journal publisher; Ownership: Reviews owned by the journal publisher or third party.</p>
          <p>This journal believes that Double blind peer review is extremely difficult if not impossible due to the focus on societal benefit that would often make identity of originators public either before or during the publication process through media and other channels. Moreover, there is current discussion on the validity and genuineness of double blind claims as often the identity of authors can be guessed through references or may show up on even a simple search of foundation articles over internet. Furthermore, in line with long term goals of this journal to establish pathways to alternate approaches to assessment of impact, open review is intended to be facilitated after introduction of pilot tests and subsequent establishment of robust processes.</p>
